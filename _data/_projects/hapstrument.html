    We present the Hapstrument, a novel bimanual haptic device for musical expression. Composed of two <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/fullHtml/10.1145/3462244.3481304" target="blank">Haply 2diy</a> haptic force feedback devices, the instrument allows a user to control pitch with one hand, and excitation with the other. We evaluated the Hapstrument's playability in an informal study with musicians and validated our original design goal through a live performance with the Hapstrument.
    <br/><br/>
    The Hapstrument was a result of the graduate level course <i>CanHap501&#58; Introduction to Haptic Information Design</i> in Winter 2022 taught by top haptic researchers in Canada as part of <a href="https://canhaptics.ca/" target="_blank">CanHaptics</a> network.
