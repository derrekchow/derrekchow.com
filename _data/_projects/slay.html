    Founded by artists Elaine Waterman and Steven Frost, Slay the Runway is a fashion design, performance, and sewing community for LGBTQIA+ teens.  Based out of Longmont's Firehouse Art Center and Boulder Public Library's BLDG 61 Maker Space this two-week intensive workshop allows teens to participate in a professionally produced runway show premiering in the ATLAS Institute's B2 Center for Media, Arts, and Performance. In addition to garment construction and design, participants will work with make-up artists, a DJ, and choreographers to present their unique looks and celebrate their identities. This one-night-only event will feature stunning fashion, drag performers, and be hosted by Twirling Tech Goddess LeeLee James.
